How do you start a blog? I've [blogged before](http://blog.derk-jan.com/) but that was more out of necessity than procrastination. I think there are a lot of cases of programmers not knowing where to start; how to begin. So we kick off with [Hello, World](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/ctut.pdf).

Hello, World. Born July, 16th 1991

I [write code](http://github.com/Derkje-J). I [drink and dance](https://www.facebook.com/dj.karrenbeld/photos). I [watch way too much television](http://trakt.tv/user/Derk-Jan). I love teaching myself some [extraordinary pieces](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiPYFoqS1JD5_BMhbEXcmQ4YBRhXrC62r). 

What more is there to tell? There is a lot.
